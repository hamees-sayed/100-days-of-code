# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Main Resource followed: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths)   


### Day 1: October 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Built my mindset first of all.  
- How we are all interconnected through the internet.  
- What are IP addresses and how DNS works.  
- Went in depth on Git, Github and its history through Git and Github tutorial. (by Apoorv Goyal on YouTube)  

**Thoughts:** It was good learning about the internet how we are all interconnected through fibre cables. Also Git seems to be a very interesting software, was a very well made technical video.
